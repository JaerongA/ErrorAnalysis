ðŸ“‚ Error Dimension | ðŸ“„ Error Class | ðŸ”¸ Error Sub-Class

<details>
<summary>ðŸ“‚ 1. Annotation Error</summary>

_Definition:_ Human error occurred during corpus annotation, which is a process involving the manual review, judgment, marking, and labeling of linguistic and clinical concepts from unstructured text.

- ðŸ“„ **1.1. Missing annotation**
  _Definition:_ Annotators fail to capture concepts due to human errors.
  _Example (delirium):_

  - Confusion/Disorientation Hendrich: Yes
  - Best Verbal Response Glasgow: Confused

- ðŸ“„ **1.2. Guideline error**
  _Definition:_ Errors occur due to conflicts between the NLP definition and the annotation guideline definition. For example, the version of the guideline does not align with the NLP version.
  _Example (delirium):_

  - Guideline definition: encephalopathy = delirium positive
  - NLP definition: encephalopathy = CAM_D

- ðŸ“„ **1.3. Misclassification**
  _Definition:_ Annotators captured incorrect concepts due to human errors.
  _Example (delirium):_
  - Screening for delirium = delirium (positive)
    -> Incorrect, screening for delirium should be marked as delirium (exclusion)

<summary>ðŸ“‚ 2. Contextual Error</summary>

_Definition:_ Information found in the context of the condition that modifies individual clinical conditions.

- ðŸ“„ **2.1. Absence of context**
  _Definition:_ NLP model falsely or partially captures concepts due to a lack of enough context to determine the certainty, status, and subject of the expression.
  _Example (delirium):_

  - â€˜Confusionâ€™ (occurs as a single concept without context)
    _Correction:_
  - Patient has a constant confused look displayed on his/her face.

- ðŸ“„ **2.2. Certainty**
  _Definition:_ NLP model falsely captures concepts due to incorrectly judging grade (within the power or capacity of someone or something), possible, probable-related terms or expressions.

  - ðŸ”¸ **2.2.1. Differential diagnosis**
    _Definition:_ Description that documents a process where clinicians consider various possible conditions or diseases that could explain a patient's symptoms before making a final diagnosis.
    _Example (SBI):_

    - One potential differential diagnosis for silent infarction could include other causes of neurological symptoms such as migraine with aura, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or small fiber neuropathy

  - ðŸ”¸ **2.2.2. Hypothetical language**
    _Definition:_ Hypothesis-related concepts or expressions.
    _Example (delirium):_

    - Patient would have delirium if the CAM screening test comes out positive

  - ðŸ”¸ **2.2.3. Medical Grading**
    _Definition:_ A model incorrectly classifies concepts due to an erroneous assessment of grade, which pertains to the ability or capacity of someone or something.
    _Example (WMD):_

    - Moderate scattered deep and subcortical punctate white matter
    - Abnormal low- density in the right parietal periventricular white matter

  - ðŸ”¸ **2.2.4. Negation**

    _Example (delirium):_

    - Not able to be easily aroused
    - Patient does not have encephalopathy.
    - No history of confusion

  - ðŸ”¸ **2.2.5. Possible and probable language**
    _Definition:_ NLP model falsely captures concepts due to incorrectly interpreting possible, probable-related terms or expressions.
    _Example (WMD):_
    - Likely/probable focus of nonspecific white matter disease
    - Possibility of demyelinating disease

- ðŸ“„ **2.3. Exclusion**
  _Definition:_ NLP model falsely captures concepts because the concepts occur in a wrong context.

  - ðŸ”¸ **2.3.1. Medical evaluation**
    _Definition:_ A description of a patient presenting to a clinic for evaluation and assessment of their condition. The concepts need to be excluded because they do not reflect the patientâ€™s disease status.
    _Example (delirium):_

    - I was called to evaluate the patient for an episode of confusion
    - Patient was screened for confusion

  - ðŸ”¸ **2.3.2. Medical instruction**
    _Definition:_ Communication of medical information, advice, and instructions to individuals seeking healthcare or treatment.

  _Example (delirium):_

  - Family History (Section ID)
  - Hypertension: Yes
  - Diabetes: Yes
    \*Family information sometimes is considered as exclusion. Failure to consider the section information can result in misclassification.

- ðŸ“„ **2.5. Temporal Status**
  _Definition:_ Temporal status refers to the current condition or state of a patient's medical or health-related information. It is used to distinguish between historical information (past status) and information that reflects the patient's current state (present status).

  - ðŸ”¸ **2.5.1. History**
    _Example (delirium):_

    - Patient has a history of hallucinations (past)
    - Patient described episodes of delirium several years ago (past)

  - Hallucinates; Hallucination;
  - Altered; Alteration; Alter

- ðŸ“„ **3.2. Orthographic error**
  _Definition:_ Orthographic errors occur when NLP models fail to capture the pre-defined concepts due to the variation in language conventions including special characters, spelling, hyphenation, capitalization, word breaks, emphasis, and punctuation.

  - ðŸ”¸ **3.2.1. Spelling error**
    _Definition:_ A spelling error occurs when a deviation from the standard or intended spelling convention of the language leads to misclassification for the model.
    _Example (delirium; fall):_

      \*Concepts or expressions that can directly/indirectly infer the target concept of interest

  - ðŸ”¸ **3.3.3. Statistical inference**
    _Definition:_ Inability to make proper statistical inference. Common examples include rare expressions that, although occurring in the training data, the model is still unable to fully capture all possible cases.
    _Example (fall):_

    - Common expression: patient fell.
    - Rare expression: when he went down, his hands were behind him.

  - ðŸ”¸ **3.3.4. Synonym**

  - ðŸ”¸ **3.4.1. Sentence boundaries**
    _Definition:_ Sentence boundary detection is a task of segmenting individual sentences within a block of clinical text. Imperfect sentence boundaries, due to the lack of punctuation, can cause errors for sentence-level classifiers or extractors.
    _Example (fall):_
    - Patient did not have dementia; but had several syncope events.

- ðŸ“„ **3.5. Typographical error**
  _Definition:_ Typographical errors occur when NLP models fail to capture the pre-defined concepts due to the variation in the physical representation and appearance of text.

- ðŸ“„ **5.2. Dictionary error**
  _Definition:_ An error made by a middleware dictionary or knowledge base such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings).
  _Example:_

  - UMLS synonymy error
  - UMLS absence error

- ðŸ“„ **5.3. Normalization error**
  _Definition:_ An error occurred while mapping medical mentions to standardized ontologies like UMLS or controlled vocabularies like SNOMED CT.
  _Example:_
  - In UMLS, some medications' descriptions contain strength information, including "cyanocobalamin 1000 MCG Oral Tablet" (CUI: C0976004), "cyanocobalamin 1000 MCG Oral Capsule" (CUI: C0786262), etc. Based on the example: "2. Cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection DAILY (Daily) for 3 days," the system matched "Cyanocobalamin 1000" to CUI-C0976004 as a medication and ignored "1000 mcg/ml" as a strength.
