# An Error Taxonomy for Advancing Systematic Error Analysis in Multi-site Electronic Health Record-based Clinical Concept Extraction

## we iteratively developed and evaluated an error taxonomy based on existing literature, standards, real-world data, multisite case evaluations, and community feedback. The finalized taxonomy was released in both .dtd and.owl formats at the OHNLP consortium. The taxonomy is compatible with several different open-source annotation tools, including MAE, Brat, and MedTator.

## An example of an error annotation analytical module on MedTator is illustrated in the figure below. The module provides post-error summary statistics (under the Error Summary Tab), Error Distribution, t-SNE visualization of error textual cosine similarity (Tag Distribution), and Error List. The visual analytics module helps to break down the number of false positive and negative cases, followed by error dimensions (annotation, contextual, linguistic, and logic), followed by each unique error type and specific concept.
